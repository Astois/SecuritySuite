# SecuritySuite
 A program to find a file on a file system â€“ Develop a secure Python program for locating files within a file system. The program should prioritize security considerations throughout its design and implementation. It must prompt the user for the filename and then systematically scan the file system to locate the specified file. Upon finding the file, the program should display its precise location. Implement security measures to prevent potential vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, or exploitation during the file search process. Consider incorporating access controls, input validation, and error handling mechanisms to ensure the program operates securely and reliably. ii. A program to count how many files are on a file system and display summary information regarding the total number of bytes used by all files and a breakdown of the number of bytes used by files with common file extensions (for example, .exe, .com, .dll, .txt, .docx or others of your own choice). Implement input validation, and error-handling mechanisms to fortify the overall security posture. Consider adopting secure coding practices (defence programming) to mitigate risks associated with file system interactions, in data retrieval processes
